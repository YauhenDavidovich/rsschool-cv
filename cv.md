## Summary

I am currently employed in the Jewelry Manufacture as a CNC machines operator. Although I love my current role, I feel I&#39;m now ready for a more challenging assignment and the web development really excites me.
I'm constantly engaged in self-improvement and strive to achieve results in what I do, my goal is to use my received knowledge in practice. I can describe myself as a hard-working, responsible and highly organized person. One of my main strength is the ability to work in a fast rhythm under pressure. I&#39;m a perfectionist. I pay attention to all the details, and like to be sure that everything is just right.
